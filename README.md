# ProjectRust

This is the source code for the Rust Programming course project. The topic is about inventory management application for FHWS Laboratory.

Currently still on going as there are still a lot of things to improve

Things to do for this project:
Binding the item quantity still not working 
time for lending and returning still not set (currently using chrono now)
ID input manual, not yet auto generated based on the items
JSON serializing and deserializing still not working properly
No smoke testing yet

Things to improve user experience:
Need UI
Separating modules instead of one big fn main()
